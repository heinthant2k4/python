# 🐍 Python Mastery: Semester Break Edition

> *"The best time to learn Python was yesterday. The second best time is right now during break!"*

## What's This?

Welcome to my personal Python dojo! This is where I'm transforming from intermediate Python dabbler to Python wizard during my semester break. No classes, no deadlines—just pure, caffeinated coding.

## Mission

Level up from "I know loops and functions" to "I can build anything with Python" before the next semester starts. 

## What's Inside

This repo tracks my journey through:
- Advanced Python concepts
- Real projects (because tutorials only get you so far)
- Code experiments and "let's see what breaks" moments
- Notes, resources, and those "aha!" insights

## Current Status

🎯 **Goal**: Master intermediate → advanced Python  
📅 **Timeline**: Semester Break  
☕🚬 **Fuel**: Coffee and cigs (lots of it)  
🚀 **Vibe**: Learning by building
